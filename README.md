# SoundSync
SoundSync is a music playlist generator built in C during my 3rd semester, using DSA for efficient music management.  
As a conceptual model, it helped me understand how apps like Spotify structure playlists and generate recommendations. 
I plan to enhance it with better algorithms and data structures for real-world applications in future semesters.
